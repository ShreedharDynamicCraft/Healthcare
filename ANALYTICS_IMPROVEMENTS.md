# Analytics Page Improvements - FINAL UPDATE

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Real Data Integration

Source: Appointments + Queue Data
Process: 
1. Create unique patient records by phone/email/name
2. Track registration date (earliest interaction)
3. Aggregate visits and appointments
4. Combine with queue entries
Result: Accurate patient count and registration analytics
```

### Queue Statistics
```
Source: Live Queue Management Data
Metrics: Total, Waiting, In-Session, Completed
Updates: Real-time sync with queue management system
Display: Dedicated queue status breakdown section
```

### Appointment Analytics
